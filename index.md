## Welcome to NESCAST Project

NESCAST is an open source project to develop automatic test equipments control software for laboratory, it uses LabVIEW as primary developemt tool, as well as C# .net technology. The user can run the entire project under LabVIEW 2014 or higher runtime environment, however, if you want to develop or modify, it has to be made under LabVIEW develpment environment, which requires license.

We are trying to make effort to move the project to other language so as to make the entire project free to develop. The progresses will be submitted under this project too.

### Development Enviroment
NESCAST is not a purely software project, the system is meant to run on a target test system which consists of software, digital /anolog input/ output computer cards, relays, sensors ,operation mechanism and test samples. However, you can run the system under simulatied environment with limited functions. Following list is the software needed for the development of this project.
- NI LabVIEW 2014, professional version
- NI Requirements Gateway 2014
- NI Test Stand 2014
- NI DAQmx 2014
- VI Package manager 2016
- MGI Actor Framework Message Maker 1.0.0.17
- Windows 7 or 10 system
