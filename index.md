## Welcome to Pyindus Project

pyIndus Project is used for python study, for current purpose, it will mainly focus on GUI using PyQt5, web frame work using Django or flask, machine learning and other topics. However, the reason I study to learn python is to make use to industrial area, that is why the project pyIndus come from.

Before python, I used LabVIEW for years, and before LabVIEW, my experiences were mostly on Programmable Logic Controllers as well as SCADA softwares, all of which were expensive but not good to use. I learned VB and later C# and wrote some programs in industrial area, which meant to be a replacement of above industry softwares.

To make things better, I am also learning raspberryPi as well as Arduino and DSP and trying to merge the embeded hardware and software together, this is part of the IOT idea in industry.
